## Overview

Wireless research and education are often hindered by the fact that RF
electromagnetic signals are invisible and therefore hard to visualize.
Domain-specific software, such as those used for antenna radiation pattern
measurements, has significantly enhanced the level of radiation visualization
through interactive 3D plots. However, the intuition stops there and does not
carry over into the real-word operational environment of antennas and radios. As
a result, there exists a real disconnect in visualization between the available
antenna radiation patterns and their effects on wireless network performance. 

In this demo, we present BeamViewer, an augmented
reality framework to help visualize and capture the dynamic radiation
patterns of reconfigurable antennas in real time.  BeamViewer takes inputs
from the cognitive radios controlling beam-steerable antennas and annotates
on a live-view mobile screen the active pre-measured radiation patterns.
This capability adds an unprecedented level of instant visualization and
provides valuable insights into the dynamics of a
reconfigurable antenna-based cognitive radio network.
